- Must use readily available materials
- Must be usable by students in a classroom

## Equipment

- Hex paper
  - Scale 1/2 inch spacing, letter sized (12 longways)
    - [Downloadable version](https://www.printablepaper.net/preview/hexagon-portrait-letter-2)
- Sticky notes
  - Scale: the small skinny ones (TODO: link)
  - Writable (i.e., not the glossy ones)

## git init
The command `git init` is used to set up local repository.

In this section we will set up the game board that represents the local git repository. The game board consists of two sheets of paper - one representing the Repository, and the other representing the Staging Area and the Working Directory.

<table>
<tr><td>Repository<br>(hex paper)<br><br></td></tr>
<tr><td>Staging Area<br>
(blank paper)<br>
Working Directory</td></tr>
</table>

### The Repository
The Repository is represented by a sheet of hex paper (in landscape orientation) at the top of the game board. Label this sheet of paper "Repository".

### The Staging Area
The Staging Area is represented as the top half of a sheet of blank paper (in landscape orientation) just below the Repository. Label this sheet of paper "Staging Area".

### The Working Directory
The Working Directory is represented as the bottom half of the sheet of blank paper just below the Staging Area. Label this sheet of paper "Working Directory".
